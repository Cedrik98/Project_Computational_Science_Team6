# Project_Computational_Science_Team6
This project simulates a festival where people dance, go to the bar or visited the toilet.

The run the model open the .nlogo file in Netlogo. Click on 'setup', 'go' and watch people enjoy our festival. You can adjust the crowd size and the percentage of vacinated people. You can also turn on a feature that shows the place where an infection happens.

Python file analyse.py is used for creating the graphs that analyse different crowd sizes and different amount of people vaccinated.

For more info check the info tab in Netlogo.
